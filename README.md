# isethyperspectral

We used this repository to organize the hyperspectral database that we share from the Stanford Digital Repository and that can be found through the links on [this ISETCam wiki page](https://github.com/ISET/isetcam/wiki/Spectral-scene-database). 

This repository has the provenance for how we transform the Hyspex data into ISETCam scene data. 

The scripts also illustrate how we use the hypercube (hc) functions that are built into ISETCam to analyze the hyperspectral data.

We are now in the process of placing the multispectral scene data on the Stanford Digital Repository site.

Finally, we will place the high dynamic range (HDR) images on the Stanford Digital Repository site.
